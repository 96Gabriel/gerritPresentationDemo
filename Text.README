This is the file to be showed in the practical presentation of gerrit.

It is a simple java app that gets two numbers given by the user and divides them.
However, if the user inputs an denominator equal to 0, the output of the division result will display "Infinity", which shall not happen.
So, we should put the denominator expressions inside a do while loop, which will execute these expressions over and over again while  the denominator is equal to 0.
